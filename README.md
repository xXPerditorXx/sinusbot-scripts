# Scripts for Sinusbot

I always had the problem that the scripts for Sinusbot didn't work, which is why I decided to write my own scripts.

So in this repo you'll find my scripts for Sinusbot, which should hopefully work, if not, please create an issue.

# Repo Content

All my scripts register a Sinusbot Command, so keep in mind to use your prefix before the command.

**youtube_search.js:** *Get the YouTube Api Key at the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)* <br>
`ytsearch` or `yts` plays a video by searching for it.<br>
`ytsearchdl` or `ytsdl` searches video, downloads and plays it.<br>
`qytsearch` or `qyts` searches a video and adds it to the queue<br>
`qytsearchdl` or `qytsdl` searches a video, downloads it and adds it to the queue.<br>


**followme.js:** *Original created by Sinusbot Team.* <br>
The bot follows you in every channel you go, while it never stops playing the stop.
Activate/Deactivate following with `follow`.
