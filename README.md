# Scripts for Sinusbot
I always had the problem that the scripts for Sinusbot didn't work, which is why I decided to write my own scripts.

So in this repo you'll find my scripts for Sinusbot, which should hopefully work.
<br><br><br><br>

# Repo Content
All my scripts register a Sinusbot Command, so keep in mind to use your prefix before the command.
<br><br><br>
**youtube_search.js:**<br>
Searches with the command `ytsearch` or `yts` via the YouTube API. Afterwards it plays the Video for you.<br>
`ytsearchdl` and `ytsdl` do almost the same thing, but this time, the Video gets download and imported to Sinusbot first.

*To get the YouTube Api Key, go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard and create an Api-Key for YouTube.*
